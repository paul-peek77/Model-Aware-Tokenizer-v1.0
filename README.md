# Model Aware Tokenizer, v1.0

This project is provided for portfolio review only. No permission is granted for reuse, modification, or redistribution.

OVERVIEW

The Model‑Aware Token Measurement Tool provides accurate token counts for text using the tokenization rules of different AI models. It is designed to support context‑window planning, large‑document ingestion, and workflow optimization for AI‑driven systems.

This project demonstrates:
- tokenizer mechanics
- model‑specific tokenization
- context‑window awareness
- AI workflow tooling
- cross‑platform scripting

KEY FEATURES

- Model‑specific token counting — supports multiple tokenizer configurations
- Accurate context‑window planning — helps prevent truncation and overflow
- Large‑document support — handles long inputs cleanly
- Cross‑platform scripting — works on Windows and Linux
- Developer‑friendly output — clear, structured token reports

PURPOSE

This tool was built to support AI‑adjacent workflows by providing precise token measurements for different models. It also serves as a demonstration of tokenizer understanding, workflow design, and practical AI tooling.
